# Snake-Game-in-C
# The project that we programmed describes a snake (Magini) that moves around the screen and has the goal of approaching a moogle. 
# Once she interacts with the moogle, her score increases by 1, and Magini grows larger by one cell size. 
# The game comes to an end when Magini either covers the entire board, bumps into a wall or bumps into herself. 
# In order to effectively demonstrate this game, an algorithm has been implemented to automate the snakeâ€™s motion 
# and maximize the number of points that Magini can acquire before the game ends.
